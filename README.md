üí° Features

What features are required for your minimum viable product?
	Web
A user can register and login to their account.
A user can add their AirBnB listings to their profile.
A user can edit properties about each listing (ex: room type, minimum number of nights, location.)
 Make sure to collaborate with the DS students on the best data to send to them. When properties are saved, the data is sent to the DS API and the returned optimal price is dynamically saved for the current property.
A user can edit properties for their listings and get an updated optimal price.
A user can delete listings.
DS
Train a predictive model on AirBnB prices using historical data.
Make predictions accessible to the rest of the team. (Ex: deploy via a Flask API [or equivalent] to receive inputs (location, size, etc) and output predicted optimal price in JSON format.

What features may you wish to put in a future release?
	Web:
A user can add pictures to their listings using an API like Cloudinary.
A user can set their database to check the optimal price at certain intervals (weekly, monthly) and they are alerted when there is a change via email or text.
DS
Use feature importances to create visual recommendations to user (ex: You're in the green zone in terms of location, but your availability is in the red zone).

We are trying to figure out what the optimal price is for a user to predict the trends for optimal pricing for their properties based on variables such as location, time of year and other considerations. The data will be based on historical data from AirBnB‚Äôs prices via training a model.
